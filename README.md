## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for PostgreSQL)



### Local Environment

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 2. Build the application
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 3. Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### API Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- **OpenAPI Spec**: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs

### Testing with Swagger

The application is pre-loaded with seed data, so you can exercise the API immediately. Path parameters and request bodies in Swagger UI are pre-filled with example values from the seed data. Common IDs to try:

- **Customers**: 1–5
- **Products**: 1–3
- **Loans**: 1–8

## Design Decisions

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Bounded Contexts**: Product, Customer, Loan, Notification
- **Value Objects**: `Money` (immutable, prevents currency bugs), `TenureConfig`, `IdempotencyKey`
- **Entities**: Aggregate roots with business logic (`Loan`, `Customer`, `LoanProduct`)
- **Domain Events**: Decoupled communication between contexts via Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher`

### State Machine
- Encapsulates all valid loan lifecycle transitions
- Guard conditions prevent invalid operations (e.g., can't close loan with outstanding balance)
- States: `OPEN` -> `CLOSED` / `CANCELLED` / `OVERDUE` -> `WRITTEN_OFF`

### Strategy Pattern
- **Fee Calculation**: `FixedFeeStrategy`, `PercentageFeeStrategy`, `DailyAccrualStrategy`
- **Schedule Generation**: `LumpSumScheduleGenerator`, `InstallmentScheduleGenerator`
- **Notification Channels**: `EmailNotificationSender`, `SmsNotificationSender`, `PushNotificationSender`

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Domain events (`LoanCreatedEvent`, `PaymentReceivedEvent`, `LoanOverdueEvent`, etc.)
- Async event listeners for notifications
- Full audit trail via `LoanEventHistory`

### Loan Schedule Generation
- Strategy-based generation for Lump Sum and Installment loan types
- Installment loans support both DAYS and MONTHS tenure
- Proper remainder distribution on final installment

### Consolidated Billing
- `BillingProfile` under Customer with configurable billing day
- Multiple loans can share the same billing cycle

### Background Jobs
- `OverdueLoanSweepJob`: Daily cron job marking past-due loans as overdue
- `DailyFeeAccrualJob`: Daily fee accrual on active loans

### Idempotency
- Loan creation supports `Idempotency-Key` header
- Prevents duplicate loan disbursements
## Security

Authentication and Authorization are intentionally out of scope for this case study submission.

In a production system, this would be implemented using **Spring Security with JWT**, with the following structure:

- `ROLE_ADMIN` → full access to all endpoints
- `ROLE_LOAN_OFFICER` → loan disbursement and management
- `ROLE_VIEWER` → read-only access

Admin routes (`/api/v1/admin/**`) would be protected via role-based access control (RBAC), while customer-facing operations would require token-based authentication.

All monetary operations would additionally require audit logging tied to the authenticated principal.

## Error Handling

All errors follow the [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) standard. Example response:

```json
{
  "type": "https://lending.app/errors/not-found",
  "title": "Resource Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "Loan with ID 5 not found",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-28T20:00:00Z"
}
```

Common status codes: `400` (validation), `404` (not found), `409` (conflict), `422` (business rule violation), `500` (internal error).
## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run with coverage report
mvn test jacoco:report

# Run integration tests only
mvn test -Dtest="*IntegrationTest"

# Run unit tests only
mvn test -Dtest="*Test" -DexcludedGroups=integration
```

### Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic (Money, StateMachine), Service layer
- **Integration Tests**: Full loan lifecycle (create -> disburse -> repay -> close)

## Database

### PostgreSQL (Production)
- Docker Compose setup included
- Flyway migrations for schema versioning
- Comprehensive seed data for demonstration

### H2 (Testing)
- In-memory database for tests
- Profile: `test`

## Seed Data

The application comes pre-loaded with:
- **3 Loan Products**: 30-day payday, 6-month installment, 12-month personal
- **5 Customers**: Varying credit profiles and loan limits
- **8 Loans**: All states (OPEN, CLOSED, OVERDUE, CANCELLED)
- **Notification Templates**: For all event types across all channels
- **Sample Repayment History**: Demonstrating payment flows

## Configuration

Key settings in `application.yml`:

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `lending.jobs.overdue-sweep` | `0 0 1 * * ?` | Overdue detection cron |
| `lending.jobs.fee-accrual` | `0 30 1 * * ?` | Fee accrual cron |

## Deployment
> **Note:** The live demo is hosted on Render's free tier. 
> The first request after inactivity may take 2–3 minutes to wake up. 
> Please wait for Swagger UI to load fully before testing.

### Render 

A `render.yaml` Blueprint is included for one-click deployment.

1. Sign in to [Render](https://render.com) and click **New + → Blueprint**.
2. Connect your GitHub repo and deploy.
3. Render will create a free PostgreSQL database and build the Docker image.


The app reads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable provided by Render and converts it to Spring Boot datasource properties automatically.

### Production Deployment Considerations

The current deployment uses Render's free tier for demonstration purposes. 
For a production-grade lending system, the following platforms and practices 
would be recommended:

- **Red Hat OpenShift** — Enterprise Kubernetes platform with built-in security, 
  CI/CD pipelines, and support for regulated financial workloads
- **AWS EKS / Google GKE** — Managed Kubernetes for scalable container orchestration
- **Azure AKS** — Particularly suitable for organizations already in the Microsoft ecosystem

Production deployments would also include:
- Horizontal pod autoscaling based on loan request volume
- Multi-region database replication for high availability
- A dedicated API Gateway (e.g. Kong, AWS API Gateway) for rate limiting and auth
- Centralized logging and monitoring (e.g. ELK Stack, Prometheus + Grafana)
- Blue/green or canary deployment strategies for zero-downtime releases

### Manual Docker

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
docker build -t lending-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=... lending-app
```
